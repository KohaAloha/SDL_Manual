=head0 The Game Loop 

=head1 Simplest Game Loop

The simplest game loop can be boiled down to the following. 

=for programlisting

    while($quit)
    {
       get_events();
       calculate_next_positions();
       render();
    }

=for programlisting

In C<get_events()> we get events from what input devices that we need. It is important to process events first to prevent lag.
In C<calculate_next_positions> we update the game state according to animations and the events captured. In C<render()> we will update the screen and show the game to the player.

This game loop works really well for consoles and devices where the CPU clock speed is always known. All of your user will be using the 
processor to run this code. This means that each animation and calculation will happen at the exact same time in each machine. This is
a critical assumption when we have users with various CPU clock speeds.
