=head0 The Game Loop 

=head1 Simplest Game Loop

The simplest game loop can be boiled down to the following. 

=for programlisting

    while($quit)
    {
       get_events();
       calculate_next_positions();
       render();
    }

=for programlisting

In C<get_events()> we get events from what input devices that we need. It is important to process events first to prevent lag.
In C<calculate_next_positions> we update the game state according to animations and the events captured. In C<render()> we will update the screen and show the game to the player.
