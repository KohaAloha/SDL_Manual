=head0 Sound and Music

Sound and Music in SDL is handled by the C<Audio> and C<SDL_Mixer> components. C<Audio> is provided with the Core SDL Library and only supports wav files. C<SDL_Mixer> supports more audio file formats and has additional features. 

Similarly to video in SDL, there are several way for perl developers to access the Sound components of SDL. For the plain C<Audio> component the C<SDL::Audio> and related modules are available. C<SDL_Mixer> is supported with th C<SDL::Mixer> module. There is currently a C<SDLx::Sound> module in the work, but not completed at the time of writing this manual. For that reason this chapter will use C<SDL::Audio> and C<SDL::Mixer>.
