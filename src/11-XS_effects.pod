=head0 Pixel Effects

In this chapter we will look at how to use pixel effects in Perl. Pixel effects are operations that are done directly on the bacnk of a C<SDL_Surface>'s pixel. These effects are used to do visual effects in games and applications, most notably by C<Frozen Bubble>.

=for figure
       \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../src/images/effects.png}
        \caption{Snow Effect covering Frozen Bubble's Logo }
         \label{fig:pong1}

These effects can be done in purely in Perl, for 1 passes and non real time applications. Effects that need to be done real time will have to be done in C via XS. This chapter will show two methods of doing this.

=head1 Inline Effects 

=for figure
       \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../src/images/xs_effects.png}
        \caption{Sol's Chapter 01 Ripple Effect}
         \label{fig:pong1}

=head2 Ripple Effect

Lets try this from perl.

=head2 Color in Detail

Fiddling Bits.

=head1 Moving it to XS

Making it usable at least.

=for vim: spell
