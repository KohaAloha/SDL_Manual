=head0 Preface

I<SimpleMedia Direct Library> is a cross-platform C library that provides access
to several input and output devices. Most popularly it is used for its access
to the 2D video framebuffer and inputs for games. 

In addition to the core libsdl there are several other libraries that provide many
features such as I<Text>, I<Mixers>, I<Images> and I<GFX>.

SDL Perl binds several of these libraries as closely as possible in the C<SDL::*> namespace.
Moreover SDL Perl provides several high level libraries in the C<SDLx::*> namespace.

=head1 Audience

This book is written for new users of SDL Perl who have done some Perl. It is not necessary
for the audience to be aware SDL internals, as this book covers most areas as it goes.

=head1 Format of this book

This book will be formated into chapters that progressively increase in topics and complexity. However
each chapter can be treated as separate tutorials to jump to and learn.

Each chapter will have a specific task (i.e. I<Making Pong>), which we will work towards. The source
for each chapter will be broken up and exaplained. Sources and data files will be provided on L<http://sdl.perl.org>.

Finally the chapters will end with a exercise the reader can try out.

=head1 Purpose of this book

This book is intended to introduce game development to Perl programmers and at the same time introduce Modern Perl
through game development. The book will aim to provide simple to intermediate examples and provide suggestions for more
advanced endeavours.

=head1 Installing SDL Perl

=head2 CPAN install 

    cpan SDL

For most platforms a CPAN install will suffice. Supported and tested platforms are displayed at U<http://pass.cpantesters.org/distro/S/SDL.html>.
 
=head3 SDL dependencies

=over 3

=item * Windows

C<Alien::SDL> will install binaries for 32bit and 64bit so there is no need to compile anything.

=item * MacOSX

=over 2

=item * Fink

Fink has packages for SDL Perl available. However Pango is not currently supported.

=item * Compiling Dependencies

C<Alien::SDL> will compile SDL dependencies from scratch with no problems as long some prerequisites are installed. C<libfreetype6>, C<libX11>, C<libvorbis>, and C<libpng> headers will suffice for most examples in this book.
