=head0 Profiling

Games generally need to be as tight in using memory and CPU as possible. Although Perl is generally thought to be too slow 
for games, this is not always the case. Usually Perl will be quicker to develop code in after which many steps can be taken 
`to profile the code for production use. However the key step is to first write code without concern of optimizations. 

=head1 Make some code first

Make a Perl draft first, go make it now. Why are you still here, go make it! Don't optimize anything, nothing at all.

=head1 Profile

Run NYTProf. 

=head2 Calls

What is called often? Load time? Run time? In the game loop?

=head1 Optimize

=head2 Algorithms

Are you doing something inefficent? Is there a well know algorithm to do this?

=head2 Design Patterns

Any design patterns that can do what you need? Maybe use modules that do this for you.

=head2 XS

Nothing else left? Move it to C.
