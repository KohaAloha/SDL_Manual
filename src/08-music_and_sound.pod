=head0 Sound and Music

Sound and Music in SDL is handled by the C<Audio> and C<SDL_Mixer> components. Enabling C<Audio> devices is provided with the Core SDL Library and only supports wav files. C<SDL_Mixer> supports more audio file formats and has additional features that we need for sound in Game Development. 

Similarly to video in SDL, there are several way for perl developers to access the Sound components of SDL. For the plain C<Audio> component the C<SDL::Audio> and related modules are available. C<SDL_Mixer> is supported with th C<SDL::Mixer> module. There is currently a C<SDLx::Sound> module in the work, but not completed at the time of writing this manual. For that reason this chapter will use C<SDL::Audio> and C<SDL::Mixer>.  

=head1 Simple Sound Script

To begin using sound we must enable and open an audiospec:

   use strict;
   use warnings;
   use SDL;
   use Carp;
   use SDL::Audio;
   use SDL::Mixer;
   
   SDL::init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO);
   
   unless( SDL::Mixer::open_audio( 44100, AUDIO_S16SYS, 2, 4096 ) == 0 )
   {
      Carp::croak "Cannot open audio: ".SDL::get_error(); 
   }
   

C<open_audio> will open an audio device with frequency at 44100 Mhz, audio format AUDIO_S16SYS (Note: This is currently the most portable format, however there are others), 2 channels and a chunk size of 4096. Fiddle with these values if you are comfortable with sound terminology and techniques. 

=head2 Loading Samples

Next we will load sound samples that generally used for sound effects and the like. Currently C<SDL_Mixer> reserves samples for C<.WAV>, C<.AIFF>, C<.RIFF>  C<.OGG>, and C<.VOC> formats. 

Samples run on one of the 2 channels that we opened up, while the other channel will be reserved for multiple plays of the sample. To load samples we will be doing the following:

   +use SDL::Mixer::Samples;

   +#Brillant Lazer Sound from U<http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=30935>
   +my $sample = SDL::Mixer::Samples::load_WAV('data/sample.wav');

   +unless($sample)
   +{
   +   Carp::croak "Cannot load file data/sample.wav: ".SDL::get_error();   
   +}

=head2 Playing the sample and closing audio

Now we can play that sample on any open channel looping forever:

    use SDL::Mixer::Samples;
   +use SDL::Mixer::Channels;
   
   my $sample =  SDL::Mixer::Samples::load_WAV('data/sample.wav');
   unless( $sample)
   {
      Carp::croak "Cannot load file data/sample.wav: ".SDL::get_error(); 
   }

   +my $playing_channel = SDL::Mixer::Channels::play_channel( -1, $sample, 0 );

C<play_channel> allows us to assign a sample to the channel C<-1> which indicates any open channel. C<0> indicates we want to play the sample only once.

Note that since the sound will be playing in an external process we will need to keep the perl script running. In a game this is no problem but for a single script like this we can just use a simple C<sleep> function. Once we are done we can go ahead and close the audio device.

   +sleep(1);
   +SDL::Mixer::close_audio();

=head2 Streaming Music

Next we will use C<SDL::Mixer::Music> to add a background music to our script here. 

    use SDL::Mixer::Channels;
    +use SDL::Mixer::Music;

    +#Load our awesome music from U<http://8bitcollective.com>
    +my $background_music = 
	+         SDL::Mixer::Music::load_MUS('data/music/01-PC-Speaker-Sorrow.ogg');


    +unless( $background_music )
    +{
    +   Carp::croak "Cannot load music file data/music/01-PC-Speaker-Sorrow.ogg: ".SDL::get_error() ;
    +}

Music types in C<SDL::Mixer> run in a seperate channel from our samples which allows us to have sound effects (like jump, or lasers etc) to play at the same time. 

   +SDL::Mixer::Music::play_music($background_music,0); 

C<play_music> also takes a parameter for how many loops you would like to play the song for, where 0 is 1. 

To stop the music we can call C<halt_music>.

    sleep(2);
   +SDL::Mixer::Music::halt_music();
    SDL::Mixer::close_audio();

=begin sidebar

Controlling Volume can be as simple as:
   
   #All channels indicated by the -1
   SDL::Mixer::Channels::volume(-1,10); 

   #Specifically for the Music
   SDL::Mixer::Music::volume_music( 10 );

Volumes can be set at anytime and range from C<1-100>.

=head2 Code so far

=begin programlisting

   use strict;
   use warnings;
   use SDL;
   use Carp;
   use SDL::Audio;
   use SDL::Mixer;
   use SDL::Mixer::Samples;
   use SDL::Mixer::Channels;
   use SDL::Mixer::Music;
   SDL::init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO);

   unless( SDL::Mixer::open_audio( 44100, AUDIO_S16SYS, 2, 4096 ) == 0 )
   {
      Carp::croak "Cannot open audio: ".SDL::get_error(); 
   }


   my $sample = SDL::Mixer::Samples::load_WAV('data/sample.wav');

   unless( $sample)
   {
      Carp::croak "Cannot load file data/sample.wav: ".SDL::get_error(); 
   }

   my $playing_channel = SDL::Mixer::Channels::play_channel( -1, $sample, 0 );

   #Load our awesome music from U<http://8bitcollective.com>
   my $background_music = SDL::Mixer::Music::load_MUS('data/music/01-PC-Speaker-Sorrow.ogg');

   unless( $background_music )
   {
      Carp::croak "Cannot load music file data/music/01-PC-Speaker-Sorrow.ogg:".SDL::get_error();
   }

   SDL::Mixer::Music::play_music( $background_music,0 );

   sleep(2);

   SDL::Mixer::Music::halt_music();
   SDL::Mixer::close_audio;

=end programlisting


=head1 Sound Applications

Now that we know how to prepare and play simple sounds we will apply it to an C<SDLx::App>.

=head2 SDLx::App Audio Initialization

C<SDLx::App> will initialize everything normally for us. However for a stream line application it is recommend to initialize only the things we need. In this case that is C<SDL_INIT_VIDEO> and C<SDL_INIT_AUDIO>.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use SDL;
    use Carp;
    use SDLx::App;
    use SDL::Audio;
    use SDL::Mixer;
    use SDL::Event;
    use SDL::Events;
    use SDL::Mixer::Music;
    use SDL::Mixer::Samples;
    use SDL::Mixer::Channels;

    my $app = SDLx::App->new(
        init  => SDL_INIT_AUDIO | SDL_INIT_VIDEO,
        width => 250,
        height => 75,
        title => "Sound Event Demo",
        eoq   => 1
  
  );

=head2 Loading Resources  

It is highly recommended to perform all resource allocations before a C<SDLx::App::run()> method is called. 


    # Initialize the Audio
    unless ( SDL::Mixer::open_audio( 44100, AUDIO_S16SYS, 2, 4096 ) == 0 ) {
        Carp::croak "Cannot open audio: " . SDL::get_error();
    }

    #Something to show while we play music and sounds
    my $channel_volume = 100;
    my $music_volume   = 100;
    my $laser_status   = 'none';
    my $music_status   = 'not playing';

    # Load our sound resources
    my $laser = SDL::Mixer::Samples::load_WAV('data/sample.wav');
    unless ($laser) {
        Carp::croak "Cannot load sound: " . SDL::get_error();
    }

    my $background_music =
    SDL::Mixer::Music::load_MUS('data/music/01-PC-Speaker-Sorrow.ogg');
    unless ($background_music) {
        Carp::croak "Cannot load music: " . SDL::get_error();
    }


=head2 The Show Handler

For the purposes of describing the current state of the music lets draw text to the screen in a C<show_handler>.

    $app->add_show_handler(
    sub { 

        $app->draw_rect([0,0,$app->w,$app->h], 0 );

        $app->draw_gfx_text( [10,10], [255,0,0,255], "Channel Volume : $channel_volume" );
        $app->draw_gfx_text( [10,25], [255,0,0,255], "Music Volume   : $music_volume" );
        $app->draw_gfx_text( [10,40], [255,0,0,255], "Laser Status   : $laser_status" );
        $app->draw_gfx_text( [10,55], [255,0,0,255], "Music Status   : $music_status" );

        $app->update();

    }
    );

This will draw the channel volume of our samples, and the volume of the music. It will also print the status of our two sounds in the application.

=head2 The Event Handler

Finally our event handler will do the actual leg work and trigger the music and sound as we need it.

    $app->add_event_handler(
        sub {
            my $event = shift;

            if ( $event->type == SDL_KEYDOWN ) {
                my $keysym  = $event->key_sym;
                my $keyname = SDL::Events::get_key_name($keysym);

                if ( $keyname eq 'space' ) {

                    $laser_status = 'PEW!';
                    #fire lasers!
                    SDL::Mixer::Channels::play_channel( -1, $laser, 0 );

                }
                elsif ( $keyname eq 'up' ) {
                    $channel_volume += 5 unless $channel_volume == 100;
                }
                elsif ( $keyname eq 'down' ) {
                    $channel_volume -= 5 unless $channel_volume == 0;
                }
                elsif ( $keyname eq 'right' ) {
                    $music_volume += 5 unless $music_volume == 100;
                }
                elsif ( $keyname eq 'left' ) {
                    $music_volume -= 5 unless $music_volume == 0;
                }
                elsif ( $keyname eq 'return' ) {
                    my $playing = SDL::Mixer::Music::playing_music();
                    my $paused  = SDL::Mixer::Music::paused_music();

                    if ( $playing == 0 && $paused == 0 ) {
                        SDL::Mixer::Music::play_music( $background_music, 1 );
                        $music_status = 'playing';
                    }
                    elsif ( $playing && !$paused ) {
                        SDL::Mixer::Music::pause_music();
                        $music_status = 'paused'
                    }
                    elsif ( $playing && $paused ) {
                        SDL::Mixer::Music::resume_music();
                        $music_status = 'resumed playing';
                    }

                }

                SDL::Mixer::Channels::volume( -1, $channel_volume );
                SDL::Mixer::Music::volume_music($music_volume);

            }

          }

    );

The above event handler fires the laser on pressing the 'Space' key. Go ahead and press it multiple times as if you are firing a gun in a game! You will notice that depending on how fast you fire the laser the application will still manage to overlap the sounds as needed. The sample overlapping is accomplished by requiring multiple channels in the C<open_audio> call. If your game has lots of samples that may play at the same time you may need more channels allocated. 
Additionally you can see that the volume control is easily managed both on the channels and the music with just incrementing or decrementing a value and calling the appropriate function. 

Finally it is worth noticing the various state the background music can be in. 

Lets run this application and the make sure to clean up the audio on the way out.
    $app->run();
    SDL::Mixer::Music::halt_music();
    SDL::Mixer::close_audio;
