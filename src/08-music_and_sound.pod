=head0 Sound and Music

Sound and Music in SDL is handled by the C<Audio> and C<SDL_Mixer> components. Enabling C<Audio> devices is provided with the Core SDL Library and only supports wav files. C<SDL_Mixer> supports more audio file formats and has additional features that we need for sound in Game Development. 

Similarly to video in SDL, there are several way for perl developers to access the Sound components of SDL. For the plain C<Audio> component the C<SDL::Audio> and related modules are available. C<SDL_Mixer> is supported with th C<SDL::Mixer> module. There is currently a C<SDLx::Sound> module in the work, but not completed at the time of writing this manual. For that reason this chapter will use C<SDL::Audio> and C<SDL::Mixer>.  

=head1 Setting Up the Audio Devices

To begin using sound we must enable and open an audiospec:

=head1 Loading Samples

The songs provided with this chapters code have been used by the talent authors on U<http://8bitcollective.com>. To see the individual credits of each song have a look at C<data/music/Songs>. This is truly a great site for game songs, but please give all artists their due credits.
