=head0 The Screen

In SDL there is a single screen which is attached to the video device. This screen is created by X<SDLx::App>.

=begin programlisting

    use SDL:
    use SDLx::App;

    my $app = SDLx::App->new();
  
    sleep( 2 );
    
=end programlisting

The above code will make a window with nothing in it. So lets add a line to make the screen a default black.

=begin programlisting

    $app->update();

=end programlisting

SDLx::App will also allow you to specify several options for our application. 

=head1 SDLx::App Options

=head2 Dimensions

First are the physical dimensions of the screen itself. Lets make the screen a square size of 400x400. Change the initialization line to:

=begin programlisting

    my $app = SDLx::App->new( width => 400, height => 400 );

=end programlisting

=head2 Title

You will notice that the window's title is either blank or the script's path, depending on your OS. Suppose we want a title for our new Pong Clone.

=begin programlisting

    my $app = SDLx::App->new( width => 400, 
                              height => 400, 
                              title => 'Ping - A clone');

=end programlisting

At this point your screen will look something like Fig:X<first_screen>. 

=for figure 
       \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../src/images/first.png}      
        \caption{Your first SDL screen!}               
        \label{fig:first_screen}   

=for vim: spell
